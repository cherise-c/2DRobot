This is a code I wrote in my AP Comp Sci Principles course at school. A big chunk was written by my teacher and my mom helped me write the rest :) (actually i couldn't have done this whithout my mom most creds to her).
Its basically a 4x9 grid with a triangle in it that moves around the grid when you use the arrow keys or 'f' key.
its pretty simple and I guess its not really a game just something to do for fun (I have no clue who would do this for fun).
